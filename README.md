# markdowndeep
Open-source implementation of Markdown for C# and Javascript

This fork adds the transformations to audio and video html tags
where there would have been an image, when the alternative text
is prefixed with either audio:`or video.

ex:

         ![video:Hello world](http://your.company.com/hello.mp4)
